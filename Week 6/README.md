# Week 6 - Arrays, Searching & Number Problems

This weekâ€™s lab focuses on array **manipulation**, **searching techniques**, and basic number algorithms. The problems range from working with arrays and **character frequency** to generating prime numbers and **Fibonacci series**.

## Topics Covered

- Working with arrays: swapping, reversing, finding maximum, minimum, and second largest element
- Searching techniques: implementing linear search
- Number problems: odd numbers, prime numbers, Fibonacci series
- String operations: finding frequency of characters
- Combining loops and logic for problem solving
