- **Problem03.java** â†’ Program to set values of FRUIT (color, taste, price) using a constructor.
- **Problem04.java** â†’ Program to implement default, one-argument, and two-argument constructors in FRUIT class.
- **Problem05.java** â†’ Program to demonstrate constructor chaining in FRUIT class using this().
- **Problem06.java** â†’ Program to create a CAR class with data members model, color, and price.
 - Includes setDetails(), getDetails(), and display() methods
 - Implements default constructor, one-argument constructor, and two-argument constructor
 - Demonstrates constructor chaining
 - Creates three objects (default, one-argument, two-argument) and sets price using setDetails()
 - Calls display() for each object
