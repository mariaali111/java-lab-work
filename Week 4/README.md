# Week 4 - Control Statements & Loops

This week's lab focuses on **decision-making** and **iteration** in Java.
The problems cover 'if-else', 'switch-case', and loop constructs ('for', 'while').

## Topics Covered
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, nested conditions)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`) for repetitive tasks  
- Using conditions to check properties of numbers  
- Combining logic with arithmetic to solve problems
